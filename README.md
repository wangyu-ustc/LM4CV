This is the official implementation of our ICCV paper **Learning Concise and Descriptive Attributes for Visual Recognition.**

## Requirements
+ torch == 2.0.1
+ python 3.9.13
+ torchvision == 0.15.2

## Datasets
+ CUB: Download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenewone/cub2002011). The downloaded files are organized as below. 
+ Stanford_Cars: Download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-cars-dataset). The downloaded files are organized as below. 
+ CIFAR10: run the code `python main.py --config configs/cifar10.yaml` then the dataset will be automatically downloaded into the folder `./data/cifar-10-batches-py`. 
+ CIFAR100: run the code `python main.py --config configs/cifar100_bn.yaml` then the datasete will be automatically downloaded into the folder `./data/cifar-100-python`. 
+ Flowers102: run the code `python main.py --config configs/flower.yaml` then the dataset will be automatically downloaded into the folder `./data/flowers-102`. 
+ Food101: run the code `python main.py --config configs/food_bn.yaml` then the datasete will be automatically downloaded into the folder `./data/food-101`. 
+ Oxford-Pets: run the code `python main.py --config configs/oxford_pets_bn.yaml` then the datasete will be automatically downloaded into the folder `./data/oxford-iiit-pet`. 
+ Imagenet-Animals: Download t he dataset from [here](https://www.image-net.org/) and the downloaded files are organized as below.

## Parameters

The following key parameters are available for customization:

- **cluster_feature_method**: Choose one from [kmeans, random, linear]. "Linear" refers to our method.
- **model_size**: Set the size of the CLIP model.
- **mahalanobis**: Enable or disable Mahalanobis distance regularization.
- **division_power**: Control the strength of Mahalanobis constraints.
- **reinit**: Decide whether to initialize the model with weights from image training features.
- **num_attributes**: Specify the number of attributes selected for classification.

Please make sure to adjust these parameters according to your requirements.
